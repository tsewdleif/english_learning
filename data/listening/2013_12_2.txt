Part II Listening Comprehension

Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Now lets begin with the eight short conversations.

1. W: Has my order arrived yet? I had been expecting it last week.

M: I called the company this morning. They've had some labor problems, so your order was shipped late.

It should be here by the end of the week.

Q: What has caused the delay of the shipment?

. . . . . .

2. W: I don't agree with Mr. Johnson's views on social welfare.

He seems to suggest the poor are robbing the rich.

M: He might have used better words to express his idea, but I think what he said makes a lot of sense.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

3. M: Liz, I just found out I have a meeting and can't pick up the kids after their soccer practice.

Will you be able to pick them up in time?

W: Yes, that won't be a problem. I think I can finish early today.

Q: Why does the man say he can't pick up the kids?

. . . . . .

4. W: Mary is going to get a little dog from one of her relatives.

M: Really? But I hear her apartment building is about to place a ban on pet animals.

Q: What does the man imply?

. . . . . .

5. W: I can never tell whether it's Lisa or Gale on the phone. Their voices sound incredibly similar.

M: That's about the only thing they have in common for twins, believe it or not.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

6. W: Jay, what does the fax from our associates in Britain say?

M: They want to know if the economic crisis would affect our ability to carry out the deal we signed last November.

Q: What are the speakers talking about?

. . . . . .

7. M: Do you think you'll be able to get this ink stain out of my pants?

W: It won't be a problem, but I need to send them over to our main cleaning facility. That's an extra day's time.

Q: What does the woman mean?

. . . . . .

8. W: That looks like a protest rally. I wonder what they are protesting against.

M: That sign says they are against importing luxury goods from Europe.

They seem to be getting so worked up about that.

Q: What are the speakers talking about?

. . . . . .

Now you will hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: What is it, Bob? You sounded pretty serious on the phone. Have we still got a budget problem?

M: I don' know. I hope not. The meeting's on Friday. But that's not what I want to talk to you about.

Er, close the door, will you? It's Marsha.

W: Marsha? What about her?

M: I'm worried. I don't know what to do. She's just not performing. We may have to let her go.

W: Fire her? She's been with us a long time, Bob. If she leaves, it'll be a big loss to us. She's done really excellent work.

M: Yes. But lately, the last month or so, in fact, there have been a lot of problems. She's changed.

Not only does she have a tendency to be moody all the time, but she misses appointments, doesn't follow through on projects, and doesn't seem to plan anything till the last minute.

W: Em, did she ever explain why she didn't show up for the Denver trip?

M: No. She said she was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.

Something about her mixed up on arrangements to get to the airport.

Now, whenever anybody mentions the subject to her, she just goes silent. I don't know.

Thank goodness. David pulled us out of the hole on that one.

W: Yes, he did a really fine job, filling in for Marsha like that at the last minute.

M: I don't think it was the first time he's had to do that. If we knew all the facts, I think we'd find that he's been covering for Marsha on quite a few projects.

Questions 9 to 12 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

9. What did the man do before he came to see the woman?

. . . . . .

10. What does the man say about Marsha?

. . . . . .

11. How did Marsha explain why she didn't show up for the Denver trip?

. . . . . .

12. What does the man say about David?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

M: You're the headmistress of Oxford High School for girls. How many girls do you have here?

W: We have 650 girls.

M: In your experience, do girls do better academically and later professionally in single-sex schools?

W: Yes. I think they do better academically and you can measure that very crudely from examination results.

I also think they do better academically because they have more opportunities to take the leading role in discussions and in managerial responsibilities.

I think they see the role models of the chief positions in the school being held by women.

M: I wonder if you could say then, in a few words, what the advantages are for a girl at a single-sex school.

W: Well, I think within the classroom, she's going to have full opportunity to express her own opinions.

She isn't going to be shouted down by over-confident young gentlemen.

M: Are teenagers in particular, do you think, sheltered too much from contact with the opposite sex?

Does this cause them difficulties when they find themselves in mixed groups?

W: Well, I would like to find the parents who could shelter girls from the opposite sex if they live in Oxford.

They encounter boys all the time socially out of school, and through debating societies and things like that, some school activities as well.

M: So, no disadvantages at all?

W: I don't think there are any disadvantages. I think that is grossly overstated that one needs to have contact with the opposite sex right through the whole of life, in the classroom and outside the classroom and at all ages.

Questions 13 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

13. What does the woman say about the girls in her school?

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

Larry arrived early for his speaking engagement. He positioned the table so that he could move close to the audience that's the strategic point in the speech.

He had read that speakers can be more persuasive if they invade the personal space of listeners, encouraging an emotional response.

For the same reason, he placed the chairs close to each other and raised the temperature to a slightly uncomfortable level.

The purpose of the speech was to encourage the audience of corporate executives and local business owners to support local sports groups.

To enhance his credibility with the audience, Larry had brought some slides of his family attending sports events.

One photo showed him at an award ceremony, where he had been honored for his financial contribution to a local baseball team.

Realizing that this particular audience would find his regional accent unattractive, Larry planned to speak with an accent that would be more acceptable to his audience.

After reading a book on how to address for success, he had purchased an expensive dark navy suit and golden tie.

He chose colors and styles known to communicate power and influence.

Just before people began entering the hall, Larry dimmed the lights and turned up the sound system, which was playing soft music, hoping to create a warm personal atmosphere for the speech.

He hoped that these added effects would encourage his audience to support local sports teams.

He had also planned the content of his speech to focus on the teams with the best records, the ones that had won the most games in the last season.

Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.

16. How can a speaker make himself more persuasive when delivering a speech?

. . . . . .

17. For what purpose was Larry going to make a speech?

. . . . . .

18. Why did Larry purchase an expensive navy suit and golden tie?

. . . . . .

19. Why did Larry dim the lights and turn up the sound system before people entered the hall?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

Phillis Wheatley was a young African-American slave who belonged to landowner John Wheatley in Colonial America.

She was also a poet and the first African-American ever to publish a book.

Her Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral was printed in Boston in 1773, three years before the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Early slaves were generally denied education, but Wheatley was allowed by her owner to study poetry, Latin and the Bible.

And by the time she reached her late teens, she had written enough poetry to put together a slender book of verse.

Even so, publication was difficult.

The publisher, fearful of being cheated, forced her to submit to a scholarly examination by a board of educated men, including the colonial governor.

The board of judges questioned Wheatley extensively and ruled that she was educated enough to have written the book.

Only then was publication permitted. Wheatley may have been the first, but she was not the only slave to write a book during the growing days of the Republic.

Unfortunately, most of the early popular African-American writers have been all but forgotten in modern times until now.

A Cornell professor, Henry Louis Gates, recently started a research project looking into 19th century African-American fictions and poetry.

In the process, he uncovered numerous lost works, almost half of which were written by African-American women.

In varied literary styles, the newly resurfaced manuscripts offered a rich stock of African-American culture, recreating among other things the early days of slavery and the importance of religion to the slaves.

Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.

20. What does the speaker say about Phillis Wheatley?

. . . . . .

21. What was Wheatley forced to do to get her book published?

. . . . . .

22. What did Prof. Henry Louis Gates uncover in the process of his research?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

In today's personality stakes, nothing is more highly valued than the sense of humor.

We seek it out in others and are proud to claim it in ourselves, perhaps even more than good looks or intelligence.

If someone has a great sense of humor, we reason, it means that they are happy, socially confident and have a healthy perspective on life.

This attitude would have surprised the ancient Greeks, who believed humor to be essentially aggressive.

And in fact, our admiration for the comically gifted is relatively new and not very well-founded, says Rod Martin, a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario.

Being funny isn't necessarily an indicator of good social skills and well-being, his research has shown, it may just exactly be a sign of personality flaws.

He has found that humor is a double-edged sword.

It can forge better relationships and help you cope with life, or it can be corrosive, eating away self-esteem and irritating others.

It's a form of communication, like speech, and we all use it differently. says Martin.

We use bonding humor to enhance our social connections, but we also may employ it as a way of excluding or rejecting an outsider.

Though humor is essentially social, how you use it says a lot about your sense of self.

Those who use self-defeating humor, making fun of themselves for the enjoyment of others, tend to maintain that hostility toward themselves even when alone.

Similarly, those who are able to view the world with amused tolerance are often equally forgiving of their own shortcomings.

Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

23. How do people today view humor according to the speaker?

. . . . . .

24. What did ancient Greeks think of humor?

. . . . . .

25. What has psychologist Rod Martin found about humor?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

It is important that we be mindful of the earth, the planet out of which we are born and by which we are nourished, guided, healed-the planet, however, which we have abused to a considerable degree in these past two centuries of industrial exploitation.

This exploitation has reached such extremes that presently it appears that some hundreds of thousands of species will be extinguished before the end of the century.

In our times, human shrewdness has mastered the deep mysteries of the earth at a level far beyond the capacities of earlier peoples.

We can break the mountains apart; we can drain the rivers and flood the valleys.

We can turn the most luxuriant forests into throwaway paper products.

We can tear apart the great grass cover of the western plains and pour toxic chemicals into the soil until the soil is dead and blows away in the wind.

We can pollute the air with acids, the rivers with sewage , the seas with oil.

We can invent computers capable of processing ten million calculations per second.

And why?

To increase the volume and the speed with which we move natural resources through the consumer economy to the junk pile or the waste heap.

Our managerial skills are measured by the competence manifested in accelerating this process.

If in these activities the physical features of the planet are damaged, if the environment is made inhospitable for a multitude of living species, then so be it.

We are, supposedly, creating a technological wonder world.

Now the passage will be read again.
