Part III Listening Comprehension Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said.

Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.

11. M: Mary, could you please tell Thomas to contact me? I was hoping he'd be able to help out with the freshmen orientation program next week.

W: I would certainly tell him if I saw him, but I haven't seen him around for quite a few days.

Q: What does the woman mean?

. . . . . .

12. M: Susan, I am going to change the light bulb above the dining room table. Will you hold the ladder for me?

W: No problem. But be careful while you're up there.

Q: What does the man want the woman to do?

. . . . . .

13. W: It's freezing cold. Let me make some coffee to warm us up. Do you want a piece of pie as well?

M: Coffee sounds great. But I'm going to have dinner with some friends in a while, so I'd better skip the pie.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

14. W: How come Jim lost his job?

M: I didn't say he had lost it. All I said was if he didn't get out and start selling a few cars instead of idling around all day, he might find himself looking for a new job.

Q: What does the man say about Jim?

. . . . . .

15. M: Hello, Mary. This is Paul at the bank. Is Tony home?

W: Not yet, Paul. I don't think you can reach him at the office now, either. He phoned me five minutes ago to say he was stopping for a hair-cut on his way home.

Q: Who do you think the woman probably is?

. . . . . .

16. W: Oh! Boy! I don't understand how you got a ticket today. I always thought you were slow even driving on the less crowded fast lane.

M: I'm usually careful. But this time I thought I could get through the intersection before the light turned.

Q: What do we learn about the man?

. . . . . .

17. W: Your dog certainly seems to know you are his master. Did you have to punish him very often when you trained him?

M: I found it's much better to praise him when he obeys and not to be so fussy when he makes mistakes.

Q: What does the man say about training dogs?

. . . . . .

18. M: I am afraid there won't be time to do another tooth today. Make sure you don't eat anything like steaks for the next few hours, and we'll fill the other cavity tomorrow.

W: All right. Actually, I must hurry to the library to return some books.

Q: Where does the conversation most probably take place?

. . . . . .

Now you'll hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: John, what does digital divide mean?

M: It refers to the divide between who is online and who isn't.

They are looking at three principal portions of the American population with regard to ethnic gap, income gap and also different age groups.

W: What do they discover?

M: They find that today 30% of African Americans, 33% of Hispanic Americans, and 47% of White Americans, are online, but the largest portion of the American population are Asian Americans with a 65% online.

W: Do they offer any explanations about why this might be?

M: Well, one reason of course is income. Low-income population's use of the Internet is less. For example, for those who earn $75,000 annually, over 70% have computers linked to the Internet.

W: Well, computers are still a fairly pricey item, although prices are coming down.

M: But they're predicting that within five years double the amount of people will be using them.

W: Going back to this digital divide, do men and women use the Internet equally? Is there a gender divide?

M: No. Not only is there not a gender divide, but the prediction is this year more women will be online than men. -W: Really?

M: But the difference here is the sites they visit. Men are interested in financial and technology sites. Women tend to prefer sites dealing with more personal matters. For instance, they want to find out about women's health. So while both men and women are online, there is a difference in what they go online for.

W: Yeah. Interesting. What did the study say about the future growth?

M: Well, they're forecasting that three quarters of the country will be online within five years.

Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Conversation Two

W: Well, are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Larry?

M: I have been offered a job with a major accounting company in Los Angeles.

W: Los Angeles? That's a big decision.

M: I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.

W: It sure will. But first tell me about the job, Larry. If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.

M: I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue. I do his taxes every year. He has a big sales office in Los Angeles, and the company in Los Angeles that does his major accounting work is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.

W: That's wonderful, Larry. -M: Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L. A.

W: What about the salary? -M: The real discussion comes tomorrow.

Sue, I don't plan to make any decisions until I have a chance to talk with you about it. And I don't have to make a quick decision. They know that I'm married and that I have a family.

W: Well, there's a lot to think about. If it's a good job, then I've got to do some thinking about my career opportunities in Los Angeles.

M: And there's Cherry. I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her.

W: I think Cherry is better off staying where she is. I don't want to interrupt her school year. But I think we should talk to Cherry about all of this.

M: You're right. We'll talk to her about it.

Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One

Born and raised in central Ohio, I'm a country girl through and through.

I'm currently studying to become a physical therapist, a career path that marks a great achievement for me.

At Ohio State University, admission into the physical therapy program is intensely competitive.

I made it pass the first cut the first year I applied, but was turned down for admission.

I was crushed, because for years I have been determined to become a physical therapist.

I received advice from friends and relatives about changing my major and finding another course for my life. I just couldn't do it.

I knew I could not be as happy in another profession. So I stilled myself, began to work seriously for another year and reapplied. Happily I received notice of my admission.

Later, I found out that less than 15% of the applicants had been offered positions that year.

Now in the first two years of professional training, I couldn't be happier with my decision not to give up on my dream.

My father told me that if I wanted it badly enough, I would get in. Well, Daddy, I wanted it. So there.

After graduation, I would like to travel to another country, possibly a Latin American country and work in a children's hospital for a year or two.

So many of the children there are physically handicapped but most hospitals don't have the funding to hire trained staff to care for them properly. I would like to change that somehow.

Passage Two

Gabriela Mistral was once an ordinary teacher in a small village school in Northern Chile.

Towering mountains separated her village from the world outside.

Gabriela Mistral was only fifteen when she began teaching, but she was a good teacher.

She helped the minds of her students' scale the mountain walls and reached out to the world beyond.

For eighteen years, Gabriela devoted her life to the poor farm children of Chile's Northern valleys. During part of this time, she was director of schools in all of Chile.

Before long, many countries recognized her as a great friend of children and the leader in education.

In 1922, she was invited to Mexico to help organize the world's school system.

Two years later, Gabriela Mistral came to the United States where she served as a visiting professor in several colleges.

In New York City, a group of teachers helped to finance the publication of her first book of poetry. Some of her books have been translated into six different languages.

She gave the income from some of her books to help poor and neglected children.

Beginning in the 1920s, her interests reached out to broader fields. Statesmen asked her advice on international problems.

She tried to break through the national barriers that hindered the exchange of ideas among the Spanish speaking peoples of South America.

She tried to develop a better understanding between the United States and countries of Latin America.

In 1945, she gained worldwide recognition by winning the Nobel Prize in literature, the first Southern American to win the prize.

Passage Three

Over time animals have developed many ways to stay away from predators.

A predator is an animal that hunts and eats other animals.

Hiding is one of the best ways to stay alive. Some animals hide by looking like the places where they live.

To see how this works, let's look at the sea dragon. It is a master of disguise.

The sea dragon is covered with skin that looks like leaves. The skin helps the dragon look like a piece of seaweed.

A hungry meat eater would stay away from anything that looks like seaweed.

Other animals stay safe by showing their colors. They want other animals to see them.

Scientists call these bright colors warning colors. You have probably seen animals that have warning colors.

Some grasshoppers show off their own bright colors. Those colors don't just look attractive; they tell their enemies to stay away.

Of course, hungry predators sometimes ignore the warning.

They still go up to the grasshopper. If that happens, the grasshopper has a backup defense. It makes lots of foam.

The foam tastes so bad that the predator won't do it again.

Color doesn't offer enough protection for some other animals. They have different defenses that help them survive in the wild.

Many fish live in groups or schools. That's because there is safety in numbers.

At the first sign of trouble, schooling fish swim as close together as they can get.

Then the school of fish makes lots of twists and turns. All that movement makes it hard for predators to see individuals in a large group.

Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.

33. What is the speaker mainly talking about?

. . . . . .

34. What protects the sea dragon from a meat eater's attack?

. . . . . .

35. According to the passage, why do many fish stay in groups?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea.

When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard.

For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

Have you ever made a profit from walking a dog? Do you like working alone or in groups?

Have you ever set a world record in anything?

Answer those the right way and you could land a job at Google.

In its desperate search for more engineers and sales representatives for its rapidly growing business, Google has created an automated way to look through the more than 100,000 job applications it receives each month.

Instead of simply looking for people with straight-A's, it's starting to ask applicants to fill out an in-depth online survey that examines their attitude, behavior and personality.

Questions concern everything from the age the applicant first got excited about computers to whether the person has ever tutored.

They also seek out non-traditional information. This can include what magazines the applicant subscribes to or what pets that person has.

The answers are fed into a series of formulas created by Google's mathematicians that spit out a score from zero to 100.

This is meant to predict how well a person will fit into the freewheeling, competitive company culture.

"Google has doubled its number of employees in each of the last three years. As we get bigger, we find it harder and harder to find enough people," said Google's vice-president for people operations.

"Interviews are a terrible predictor of performance. With traditional hiring methods, we might overlook some of the best candidates," he said.

Now the passage will be read again.
