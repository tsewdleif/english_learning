College English Test (Band 6)

Part II Listening Comprehension Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Now let's begin with the 8 short conversations.

1. W: What a wonderful performance!

Your rock band has never sounded better.

M: Many thanks.

I guess all those hours of practice in the past month are finally paying off.

QWhat does the man mean?

. . . . . .

2. M: I can't decide what to do for my summer vacation.

I either want to go on a bike tour of Europe or go diving in Mexico.

W: Well, we're offering an all-inclusive two-week trip to Mexico for only 300 dollars.

QWhat does the woman suggest the man do for his vacation?

. . . . . .

3. W: How long do you think this project might take?

M: I'd say about three months, but it could take longer if something unexpected happened.

Maybe we'd better allow an extra month, so we won't have to worry about being late.

Q: Why does the man say extra time should be allowed for the project?

. . . . . .

4. M: I'm thinking about becoming a member here, and I'd like some information.

W: Sure. A three-month membership costs 150 dollars, and that includes use of the waitroom, sauna and pool.

I'll give you a free pass so that you can try out the facilities before you decide.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

. . . . . .

5. W: I'm sorry to hear that you failed the physics course, Ted.

M: Let's face it. I'm just not cut out to be a scientist.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

6. M: Gary insisted on buying the food for the picnic.

W: That's pretty generous of him. But shouldn't we at least offer to share the expenses?

He has a big family to support.

Q: What does the woman suggest they do?

. . . . . .

7. W: Did you see the headlines in the paper this morning?

M: Yeah. Apparently the bus company will be laying off its employees if they can't reach an agreement on wages by midnight.

Q: What did the man read about?

. . . . . .

8. W: Have we received payment for the overseas order we delivered last month?

M: Yes. The check came in yesterday afternoon.

I'll be depositing it when I go to the bank today.

Q: What is the woman concerned about?

. . . . . .

Now you'll hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: OK, that's it. Now we have to make a decision.

We might as well do that now, don't you think?

M: Sure, let's see. First we saw Frank Brisenski. What did you think of him?

W: Well, he's certainly a very polite young man.

M: And very relaxed, too.

W: But his appearance. . .

M: Um. . . He wasn't well-dressed. He wasn't even wearing a tie.

W: But he did have a nice voice. He'd sound good on the telephone.

M: True. And I thought he seemed very intelligent. He answered Dona's questions very well.

W: That's true, but dressing well is important. Well, let's think about the others.

Now what about Barbara Jones?

She had a nice voice, too. She'd sound good on the telephone, and she was well-dressed, too.

M: Um. . . She did look very neat, very nicely dressed, but. . .

W: But so shy. She wouldn't be very good at talking to people at the front desk.

M: Um. . . OK. Now who was the next? Ah. . . Yes, David Wallace.

I thought he was very good, had a lot of potential. What do you think?

W: Um. . . He seemed like a very bright guy. He dressed very nicely, too. And he had a really nice appearance.

M: He seemed relaxed to me, the type of person people feel comfortable with right away.

W: He was polite, but also very friendly and relaxed as you say. I think he'll be good with the guests at the front desk.

M: He had a very pleasant voice, too.

W: That's right. OK, good! I guess we have our receptionist then, don't you?

M: Yes, I think so. We'll just offer the job to. . .

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

9. What are the speakers looking for?

10. What is Frank Brisenskis' weakness?

. . . . . .

11. What do the speakers decide to do?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

W: Hello?

M: Hello. Is that the reference library?

W: Yes. Can I help you?

M: I hope so. I rang earlier and asked for some information about Dennis Hutton, the scientist. You asked me to ring back.

W: Oh, yes. I have found something.

M: Good. I've got a pencil and paper. Perhaps you could read out what it says.

W: Certainly. Hutton Dennis, born Darlington, 1836 ;died New York, 1920.

M: Yes, got that.

W: Inventor and physicist; the son of a farm worker. He was admitted to the University of London at the age of 15.

M: Yes.

W: He graduated at 17 with the first class degree in physics and mathematics. All right?

M: Yes, all right.

W: He made his first notable achievement at the age of 18. It was a method of refrigeration which arose from his work in low temperature physics.

He became a professor of Mathematics at the University of Manchester at 24, where he remained for twelve years.

During that time, he married one of his students, Natasha Willoughby.

M: Yes, go on.

W: Later working together in London, they laid the foundations of modern physics by showing that normal laws of cause and effect do not apply at the level of subatomic particles.

For this he and his wife received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1910, and did so again in 1912 for their work on very high frequency radio waves.

In his lifetime, Hutton patented 244 inventions. Do you want any more?

M: Yes. When did he go to America?

W: Let me see. In 1920 he went to teach in New York and died there suddenly after only three weeks. Still he was a good age.

M: Yes, I suppose so. Well, thanks.

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

In America, white-tailed deer are more numerous than ever before, so abundant in fact that they've become a suburban nuisance and a health hazard.

Why can't the herd be thinned the old-fashioned way? The small community of North Haven on Long Island is home to some 600 to 700 deer. The Department of Environmental Conservation estimates the optimum population at 60.

The town has been browsed bare of vegetation except where gardens and shrubs are protected by high fences.

Drivers routinely collide with deer and there are so many dead bodies left by the side of the road that the town has made a deal with a local pet cemetery to collect and dispose of the bodies.

Some people in the town have become ill from deer-transmitted diseases.

On the occasions when hunting has been tried, local animal rights people have worked to secure court orders against the hunts. And when that is failed, they stop the hunters, banging on pots and pans to alert the deer.

Town meetings called to discuss the problem inevitably dissolved into confrontations. The activists believe simply that the deer are not the problem.

Some communities have even discussed the possibility of bringing wolves back into the ecological mix. That means wolves in the suburbs of New York. It is almost too wonderful not to try it.

The wolves would kill deer of course. They would also terrorize and kill dogs and cats, which is not what the suburban dwellers have in mind.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.

16. What do we learn about white-tailed deer in North Haven?

. . . . . .

17. Why do local animal rights people bang on pots and pans?

. . . . . .

18. What would happen if wolves were brought back into the ecological mix?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

And now, if you'll walk this way, ladies and gentlemen, the next room were going to see is the room in which the family used to hold their formal dinner parties and even occasionally entertain heads of state and royalty.

However, they managed to keep this room friendly and intimate. And I think you'll agree. It has a very informal atmosphere, quite unlike some grand houses you visit.

The curtains were never drawn, even at night, so guests got a view of the lake and fountains outside which were lit up at night a very attractive sight.

As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the guests were seated very informally around this oval table, which would add to the relaxed atmosphere. The table dates from the 18th century and is made from Spanish oak. It's rather remarkable for the fact that although its extremely big, it's supported by just six rather slim legs.

However, it seems to have survived like that for 200 years. So it's probably going to last a bit longer. The chairs which go with the table are not a complete set. There were originally six of them.

They are interesting for the fact that they are very plain and undecorated for the time, with only one plain central panel at the back and no armrests.

I myself find them rather uncomfortable to sit in for very long, but people were used to more discomfort in the past. And now, ladies and gentlemen, if youd like to follow me into the great hall. . .

Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.

19. What do we learn about the speaker?

. . . . . .

20. What does the speaker say about the room they are visiting?

. . . . . .

21. What is said about the oval table in the room?

. . . . . .

22. What does the speaker say about the chairs?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

Janet James was 22 years old when she was diagnosed with MS a disease that attacks the bodys nerves.

She had just graduated from college and got a job at an advertising agency when she began to sense that something strange was going on inside her body.

When James realized how severe her illness was, she knew she had better hurry up and live life. MS is the biggest crippler of young adults. And although she didnt have many symptoms, she knew it was just a matter of time.

First on her agenda was to pursue her dream of hosting a pop music program. She worked at a radio station for a year, always aware that her body was degenerating.

Then her best friend moved away. And one night James began screaming, "I got to go! I got to go!" Two weeks later, she arrived in Alaska, thousands of miles from her friends, her family and her past.

"Everything fell into place", she recalls. A 23-year-old girl with an incurable disease can fly to Alaska and everything can work out.

The MS attacks came and went. And most of the time they hardly slowed her down. James hiked, fished, learnt to sail and experimented with hot air ballooning.

"I lived for adventure", she says. "Nobody ever had a better time or did more exotic strange things than I did in an 8-year period."

Inevitably however, the day came when she was so weakened that she had to return to Pittsburgh, her hometown.

There she began relieving her adventures by writing a book about them. Her book was published in 1993.

Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

23. What does the speaker say about MS?

. . . . . .

24. What did Janet James decide to do after her disease was diagnosed?

. . . . . .

25. What sort of person can we infer Janet James is?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

It's difficult to estimate the number of youngsters involved in home schooling where children are not sent to school and receive their formal education from one or both parents.

Legislation and court decisions have made it legally possible in most states for parents to educate their children at home, and each year more people take advantage of that opportunity.

Some states require parents or a home tutor to meet teacher certification standards, and many require parents to complete legal forms to verify that their children are receiving instruction in state-approved curricula.

Supporters of home education claim that it is less expensive and far more efficient than mass public education. Moreover, they cite several advantages: alleviation of school overcrowding, strengthened family relationships, lower dropout rates, the fact that students are allowed to learn at their own rate, increased motivation, higher standardized test scores, and reduced discipline problems.

Critics of the home schooling movement contend that it creates as many problems as it solves. They acknowledge that, in a few cases, home schooling offers educational opportunities superior to those found in most public schools, but few parents can provide such educational advantages.

Some parents who withdraw their children from the schools in favor of home schooling have an inadequate educational background and insufficient formal training to provide a satisfactory education for their children.

Typically, parents have fewer technological resources at their disposal than do schools.

However, the relatively inexpensive computer technology that is readily available today is causing some to challenge the notion that home schooling is in any way inferior to more highly structured classroom education.

Now the passage will be read again.
