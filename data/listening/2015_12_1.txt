. . . . . .

Question 5. W: I'm considering having my office redecorated.

She just graduated from an interior design academy and will give a free estimate.

Q: What is the woman considering?

. . . . . .

Question 6. W: We have a full load of goods that needs to be delivered.

Now you will hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

M: Hello, Jane.

W: Hello, Paul.

M: Please come in. I'm just getting ready to go home.

Susan is expecting me for dinner.

I wanted to be on time for a change.

W: Look, I'm terribly sorry to drop in at this time on Friday, Paul, but it is rather important.

M: That's OK. What's the problem?

W: Well, Paul, I won't keep you long.

You see there is a problem with the exchange rates.

The Indian Rupee has taken a fall on the foreign exchange market.

You see there has been a sharp increase in Indian's balance of payment deficit.

M: I see. That's serious, isn't it?

W: Well, as you know, there have been reports of unrest India, and the prospects for the Rupee look pretty gloomy.

M: And that's going to affect us, as if we didn't have enough problems on our hands.

W: So I thought it would be wise to take out forward exchange cover to protect our position on the outstanding contracts.

M: Just a minute.

Forward exchange cover?

Now what does that mean exactly?

W: Well, it means that JO Motors enters into a commitment to sell Indian Rupees at the present rate.

M: I see. And how will that benefit us?

W: Well, JO Motors won't lose out if the Indian Rupee falls further.

M: What will it cost, Jane?

W: A small percentage, about 1% and that can be built into the price of the bike.

M: Well, I don't suppose there is much choice.

All right, Jane, let's put it into action.

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Question 9. What do we learn about the man's daily life?

. . . . . .

Question 10. Why did the woman come to see the man?

. . . . . .

Question 11. What makes the woman worry about the Indian Rupee?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

W: Charles, among other things, you are regarded as one of the America's great masters of the Blues- a musical idiom does essentially about loss, particularly the loss of romantic love.

Why does love die?

M: People often get into love affairs because they have unrealistic expectations about somebody.

Then when the person doesn't turn out to be who they thought he or she was, they start thinking "maybe I can change him or her."

That kind of thinking is a mistake.

Because when the dust settles, people are going to be pretty much what they are.

It's a rare thing for anybody to be able to change who they really are.

And this creates a lot of problems.

W: At 62, you continue to spend a large percentage of your life touring.

What appeals to you about life on the road?

M: Music. I don't especially love life on the road.

But I figure if you are lucky enough to be able to do what you truly love doing, you've got the ultimate in life.

W: What's the most widely-held misconception about the life of a famous musician?

M: People think it's all glamour.

Actually we have the same trouble as they do.

Playing music doesn't mean life treats you any better.

W: How do you feel about being recognized everywhere you go?

M: You'd think I'd be used to it by now.

But I still find it fascinating.

You go to a little town in Japan, where nobody speaks English, yet they know you on site and know all your music.

I'm still amazed by the love people express for me and by music.

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

. . . . . .

Question15. How does the man feel whenever he is recognized by his fans?

. . . . . .

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) . Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

Changing technology and markets have stimulated the team approach to management.

Inflation, resource scarcity, reduced personnel levels and budget cuts have all underscore the need for better coordination in organizations.

Team management provides for this coordination.

Team management calls for new skills if personnel potential is to be fully realized.

Although a team may be composed of knowledgeable people, they must learn new ways of relating and working together to solve cross-functional problems.

When teams consist of experienced employees from hierarchical organizations who have been conditioned to traditional organizational culture, cooperation may not occur naturally.

It may need to be created.

Furthermore, the issue is not just how the team can function more effectively, but how it integrates with the overall organization or society that it supposedly serves.

A group of individuals is not automatically a team.

Therefore, team building may be necessary in order to improve the group's performance.

Casey, an expert in this field, suggests that the cooperation process within teams must be organized, promoted and managed.

He believes that team cooperation results when members go beyond their individual capabilities, beyond what each is used to being and doing.

Together, the team may then produce something new, unique and superior to that of any one member.

For this to happen, he suggests the multi-cultural managers exhibit understanding of their own and other's cultural influences and limitations.

They should also cultivate such skills as toleration of ambiguity, persistence and patience, as well as assertiveness.

If a team manager exemplifies such qualities, then the team as a whole would be better able to realize their potential and achieve their objectives.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 16. What should team members do to fully realize their potential?

. . . . . .

Question 17. What needs to be considered for effective team management?

. . . . . .

Question 18. What conclusion can we draw from what Casey says?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

In early 1994, when Mark Andreessen was just 23 years old, he arrived in Silicon Valley with an idea that would change the world.

As a student at the University of Illinois, he and his friends had developed a program called Mosaic, which allowed people to share information on the World Wide Web.

Before Mosaic, the Web had been used mainly by scientists and other technical people, who were happy just to send and receive text.

But with Mosaic, Andreessen and his friends had developed a program which could send images over the Web as well.

Mosaic was an overnight success.

It was put on the university's network at the beginning of 1993.

And by the end of the year, it had over a million users.

Soon after, Andreessen went to seek his fortune in Silicon Valley.

Once he got there, he started to have meetings with a man called Jim Clark, who was one of the Valley's most famous entrepreneurs.

In 1994, nobody was making any real money from the Internet which was still very slow and hard to use.

But Andreessen had seen an opportunity that would make him and Clark rich within two years.

He suggested they should create a new computer program that would do the same job as Mosaic but would be much easier to use.

Clark listened carefully to Andreessen, whose ideas and enthusiasm impressed him greatly.

Eventually, Clark agreed to invest three million dollars of his own money in the project, and to raise an extra 15 million from venture capitalists who were always keen to listen to Clark's new ideas.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 19. What do we learn about Mosaic?

. . . . . .

Question 20. What did Andreessen do upon arriving in Silicon Valley?

. . . . . .

Question 21. Why were venture capitalists willing to join in Clark's investment?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

Advertising informs consumers about the existence and benefits of products and services and attempts to persuade them to buy them.

The best form of advertising is probably word-of-mouth advertising which occurs when people tell their friends about the benefits of products or services that they have purchased.

Yet virtually no providers of goods or services rely on this alone, but use paid advertising instead.

Indeed many organizations also use institutional or prestige advertising which is designed to build up their reputation rather than to sell particular products.

Although large companies could easily set up their own advertising departments, write their own advertisements and buy media space themselves, they tend to use the services of large advertising agencies.

These are likely to have more resources and more knowledge about all aspects of advertising and advertising media than a single company.

It is also easier for a dissatisfied company to give its account to another agency than it would be to fire its own advertising staff.

The client company generally gives the advertising agency an agreed budget, a statement of the objectives of the advertising campaign, known as a brief and an overall advertising strategy concerning the message to be communicated to the target customers.

The agency creates advertisements and develops a media plan, specifying which media will be used and in which proportions.

Agencies often produce alternative ads or commercials that are pre-tested in newspapers, television stations, etc. , in different parts of the country before a final choice is made prior to a national campaign.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 22. What is probably the best form of advertising according to the speaker?

. . . . . .

Question 23. What does the speaker say is the purpose of many organizations' using prestige advertising?

. . . . . .

Question 24. How do large companies generally handle their advertising?

. . . . . .

Question 25. What would advertising agencies often do before a national campaign?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

Extinction is a difficult concept to grasp. It is an eternal concept.

It's not at all like the killing of individual life forms that can be renewed through normal processes of reproduction.

Nor is it simply diminishing numbers.

Nor is it damage that can somehow be remedied or for which some substitute can be found.

Nor is it something that simply affects our own generation.

Nor is it something that could be remedied by some supernatural power.

It is rather an absolute and final act for which there is no remedy on earth or in heaven.

A species once extinct is gone forever.

However many generations succeed us in coming centuries, none of them will ever see this species that we extinguish.

Not only are we bringing about the extinction of life on a vast scale, we are also making the land and the air and the sea so toxic that the very conditions of life are being destroyed.

As regards basic natural resources, not only are the nonrenewable resources being used up in a frenzy (疯狂) of processing, consuming, and disposing, but we are also ruining much of our renewable resources, such as the very soil itself on which terrestrial (地球上的) life depends.

The change that is taking place on the earth and in our minds is one of the greatest changes ever to take place in human affairs, perhaps the greatest, since what we are talking about is not simply another historical change or cultural modification, but a change of geological and biological as well as psychological order of magnitude.

Now the passage will be read again.
