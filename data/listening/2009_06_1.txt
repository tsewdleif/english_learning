College English Test - Band 6

Part III Listening Comprehension Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said.

Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.

11. W: I forgot to tell you that Fred called last night to borrow your sleeping bag.

M: Oh, I saw him at the gym this morning, but he didn't say anything. So he must have asked somebody else.

Q: What does the man imply?

. . . . . .

12. W: These summer days are getting to be more than I can take. It was even too hot to go to the pool yesterday.

M: Hang in there. According to the weather report we should have some relief by the end of the week.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

13. W: Well, tonight we have Professor Brown in our studio to talk about the famous oil painting of Queen Victoria. Good evening, professor.

M: Good evening, madam. My pleasure to be here tonight.

Q: What is the woman doing?

. . . . . .

14. M: The plants next to the window always look brown. You wouldn't know by looking at them that I water them every week.

W: Maybe they don't like direct sunlight. I had the same problem with some of my plants. And a little shade helps them immensely.

Q: What does the woman imply?

. . . . . .

15. M: I'm really exhausted, Mary. But I don't want to miss the Hollywood movie that comes on at 11.

W: If I were you, I'd skip it. We both have to get up early tomorrow. And anyway, I've heard it's not as exciting as advertised.

Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?

. . . . . .

16. M: Those modern sculptures over there are really weird. Don't you think so?

W: Well, I couldn't stand them either at first. But now I've come to like modern art, particularly those sculptures carved by Italian artists.

Q: What does the woman mean?

. . . . . .

17. M: I'm really glad our club decided to raise money for the children's hospital. And most of the people we phoned seemed happy to contribute.

W: Yeah! I agree. Now that we've gone through all the numbers on our list, I guess we can call it a day.

Q: What do we learn about the speakers?

. . . . . .

18. M: Have you heard of Professor Smith? I'm thinking of taking an advanced engineering course with him. What do you think?

W: Yeah! You really should. He's published dozens of books so far. One has been recommended as a textbook for postgraduates.

Q: What does the woman imply?

. . . . . .

Now you'll hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: You're the editor of Public Eye. What kind of topics does your program cover?

M: Well, they are essentially domestic stories. We don't cover international stories. We don't cover party politics or economics. We do issues of general social concern to our British audience. They can be anything from the future of the health service to the way the environment is going downhill.

W: How do you choose the topic? Do you choose one because it's what the public wants to know about or because it's what you feel the public ought to know about?

M: I think it's a mixture of both. Sometimes you have a strong feeling that something is important and you want to see it examined and you want to contribute to a public debate.

Sometimes people come to you with things they are worried about and they can be quite small things. They can be a story about corruption in local government, something they can't quite understand, why it doesn't seem to be working out properly, like they are not having their litter collected properly or the dustbins emptied.

W: How do you know that you've got a really successful program? One that is just right for the time?

M: I think you get a sense about it after working in it a number of years. You know which stories are going to get the attention. They are going to be published just the point when the public are concerned about that.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

19. What kind of topics does Public Eye cover?

. . . . . .

20. How does Public Eye choose its topics?

. . . . . .

21. What factor plays an important role in running a successful program?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

W: Hi, Professor Smith. I hear you've written a book titled Visions.

M: Yes. It explains how science will revolutionize the 21st century.

W: Could I ask you some questions concerning the book? -M: Sure.

W: Are you optimistic about the future?

M: Generally, yeah. If we go back to the year of 1900, most Americans didn't live beyond the age of 50. Since then we've had improvements in healthcare and technology. There is no reason why these won't continue far into the 21st century.

W: Are we ready for the changes that will come?

M: Changes are already happening. The future is here now. We have DNA, microchips, the Internet.

Some people's reaction is to say "We're too old; we don't understand new technology. "My reaction is to say "We must educate people to use new technology now."

W: Is world population going to be a big problem?

M: Yes and no. I think that world population will stop increasing as we all get richer. If you are a part of the middle class, you don't want or need 12 children.

W: Will there be a world government?

M: Very probably. We will have to manage the world and its resources on a global level, because countries alone are too small.

W: Will we have control of everything?

M: I think we'll learn to control the weather, volcanoes and earthquakes. Illness won't exist. We'll grow new livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs like spare parts for a car.

People will live till about 130 or 150. For 2000 years we have tried to understand our environment. Now we'll begin to control it.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

22. What does Professor Smith say about most Americans around the year of 1900?

. . . . . .

23. What does Professor Smith advise we do?

. . . . . .

24. When will the world population stop growing according to Professor Smith?

. . . . . .

25. What does Professor Smith think human beings will be able to do?

. . . . . .

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions.

Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One

Getting behind the wheel of a car can be an exciting new step in a teen's life.

But along with that excitement comes a new responsibility -understanding the need for common sense and maturity to avoid accidents.

In an effort to spread awareness to teens across the nation, the Allstate Foundation sponsored a Keep-The-Drive Summit at Sunset Station on January 23rd.

Students from Kennedy and Alamo Heights High schools participated in the summit which was held here for the first time.

The goal of the year-long effort is to educate teens on the rules of safe driving and the severe consequences that can result if those rules are not followed, and then have them communicate that information to their peers.

The students watched videos that told them about the numbers of teenage driving injuries and deaths.

They listened to the videos as students from other cities shared their stories of how their reckless driving affected not only their lives but also those of their passengers.

"We are trying to create awareness in high schools across the country, "said Westerman, an Allstate representative. "We focus on changing how teens think behind the wheel."

According to the presentation, more teens die in automobile crashes in the United States each year than from drugs, violence, smoking and suicide.

An average of 16 teens die every day in motor vehicle crashes and nearly 40% of those are caused by speeding.

Texas is the state with the most teen driving deaths according to the presentation.

Students agreed that the statistics were amazing and made them think twice about how they drive.

Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard.

26. For what purpose did the Allstate Foundation sponsor the Keep-The-Drive Summit?

. . . . . .

27. What causes the greatest number of deaths among American teens according to the presentation?

. . . . . .

28. What can we conclude about the Keep-The-Drive Summit?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

Dr. Alan Hirsch designs smells for businesses. He says that it doesn't take a whole lot of smell to affect you.

Store owners can lure you to the candy aisle -even if you don't realize you're smelling candy! This idea scares a lot of people.

Groups that protect the rights of shoppers are upset. They say the stores are using a kind of brainwashing, which they call "smell-washing."

"It's pretty dishonest," says Mark Silbergeld. He runs an organization that checks out products for consumers.

The scientists hired to design the scents disagree.

"There's soft background music. There's special lighting. There are all sorts of bells being used, " says Dr. Hirsch."Why not smells?"

"One reason why not," says Silbergeld, "is that some people are allergic to certain scents pumped into products or stores."

But there's a whole other side to this debate. Do the smells really work?

So far, there is little proof one way or the other. But Dr. Hirsch has run some interesting experiments.

In one of Hirsch's experiments, 31 volunteers were led into a shoe store that smelled slightly like flowers.

Later, another group shopped in the same store, but with no flower odor.

Dr. Hirsch found that 84 percent of the shoppers were more likely to buy the shoes in the flower-scented room. But Hirsch found out something even stranger.

"Whether the volunteers liked the flower scent or not didn't matter, "Hirsch says. "Some reported that they hated the smell. But they still were more likely to buy the shoes in the scented room."

Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have just heard.

29. Why are some people against the use of smells to attract customers?

. . . . . .

30. What is Dr. Hirsch's attitude to the use of smells for business?

. . . . . .

31. What did Hirsch's experiment show?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

This is Ray McCarthy with the news. Reports are coming in of a major train crash in Japan.

A passenger train carrying hundreds of workers home from the center of Tokyo is reported to have hit an oncoming goods train. Both were traveling at high speed.

Figures are not yet available but it is believed that the death toll could be as high as 300, with hundreds more injured.

Emergency and rescue services rushed to the scene. But our reporter says it will take days to clear the track and to establish the numbers of the dead and injured.

There was a similar accident on the same stretch of track four years ago.

There was another bomb scare in a large London store last night during late night shopping. Following a telephone call to the police from an anonymous caller, hundreds of shoppers were shepherded out of the store while roads in the area were sealed off.

Police dogs spent hours searching the store for a bag which the caller claimed contained 50 pounds of explosives. Nothing was found and the store was given the all-clear by opening time this morning.

A police spokesman said that this was the third bomb scare within a week and that we should all be on our guard.

And finally, the motoring organizations have issued a warning to drivers following the recent falls of snow in many parts of the country. Although the falls may be slight, they say extra care is needed.

Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.

English is the leading international language. In different countries around the globe, English is acquired as the mother tongue, in others it's used as a second language.

Some nations use English as their official language, performing the function of administration; in others it's used as an international language for business, commerce and industry.

What factors and forces have led to the spread of English?

Why is English now considered to be so prestigious that, across the globe, individuals and societies feel disadvantaged if they do not have competence in this language?

How has English changed through 1,500 years? These are some of the questions that you investigate when you study English.

You also examine the immense variability of English and come to understand how it's used as a symbol of both individual identity and social connection.

You develop in-depth knowledge of the intricate structure of the language.

Why do some non-native speakers of English claim that it's a difficult language to learn, while infants born into English-speaking communities acquire their language before they learn to use forks and knives?

At the University of Sussex, you are introduced to the nature and grammar of English in all its aspects.

This involves the study of sound structures, the formation of words, the sequencing of words and the construction of meaning, as well as examination of the theories explaining these aspects of English usage.

You are encouraged to develop your own individual responses to various practical and theoretical issues, which are raised by studying how speakers and writers employ English for a wide variety of purposes.
