College English Test (Band 6)

Part II Listening Comprehension

Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) , and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Now lets begin with the eight short conversations.

1. M: What do you think of the government's new tax cut proposal?

W: Though it may give some benefit to the poor, its key component is the elimination of tax on dividends.

That means the rich will get richer.

Q: What does the woman think of the government's tax cut proposal?

. . . . . .

2. M: Jenny, remember this: A job worth doing at all is worth doing well.

W: Oh, yes. I certainly won't forget it.

But don't expect me to stick to the job just because it pays a few more bucks.

A life of continued exploration is a life worth living.

Q: What can be inferred about the woman from the conversation?

. . . . . .

3. M: I found that one of my schoolmates uses drugs.

How can I help him, Mom?

W: Stay away from him, Son.

Never think that you can talk him out of the habit if he is addicted.

But perhaps you can talk to your teacher about the matter.

Q: What's the woman's advice to her son?

. . . . . .

4. W: I don't know how you can eat so much yet never put on any weight, Son.

Your father's got the same luck.

I can't take a bite without calculating how many calories I'm taking.

M: But remember Aunt Louise, Mom?

She ate a lot and never gained a pound.

Q: Who is worried about gaining weight?

. . . . . .

5. W: Did you turn off the lights and check the locks on all the doors?

M: Yes, I told the Johnsons we'd be gone for two weeks.

They promised to keep an eye on the house for us.

Q: What are the two speakers going to do?

. . . . . .

6. M: Hurry up, Linda! I hear that there aren't many tickets left for the football match.

W: I am ready now. Let's go.

It is the early bird that catches the worm.

Q: Why did the man ask the woman to hurry up?

. . . . . .

7. W: Did you hear that the convenience store next to the gas station was held up last night?

M: Yes, I heard it on the radio this morning.

Q: What happened to the convenience store?

. . . . . .

8. M: Congratulations! I just heard about your acceptance into a law school.

Do you think you would join your brother's firm after graduation?

W: Not likely. He is a tax lawyer, and I am going to major in criminal law.

Q: What does the woman mean?

. . . . . .

Now you will hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: Hi, Bill, how is it going?

M: Oh, hi, Jane. I'm OK. How about you?

W: You can probably tell just by looking at me.

I'm really busy. Hey, what are you reading?

M: A pretty interesting article.

My biology professor assigned it, and I thought I just looked it over.

But I got really involved in it.

It's about endangered species.

W: That sounds pretty interesting.

I'm getting frustrated with the two research papers I'm struggling with.

And can you believe they are both due on the same day?

M: That's tough.

W: I'll get through it.

So what's this you are reading?

M: Well, it's basically about the choices conservationists are faced with.

You know, these days when funding is so hard to come by.

W: Wait a minute.

Is the focus on biology or economics?

M: Both. Conservationists don't have enough funding to save every endangered species in the world, so they have to decide based on what would be lost if a species became extinct.

W: Can you give me an example of what you mean?

M: Take for instance, two animals, the spotted owl and the tailed toad.

The article says the toad is unique. It has no relatives.

But there are a lot of varieties of owls.

W: So, if that toad became extinct, we'd lose an important link in the chain of evolution, right?

M: Exactly. But that isn't so for the owl.

So for conservationists, it might be a clear choice of which animal to save.

W: I see. I am glad I don't have to make that kind of decision, aren't you?

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

9. What are the speakers mainly discussing?

. . . . . .

10. What problems do conservationists have?

. . . . . .

11. What can be inferred about the tailed toad?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

M: Good evening, dear audience.

I'm glad to continue the topic about music.

It is common knowledge that music can have a powerful effect on our emotions.

In fact, since the 1930s, music therapists have relied on music to soothe patients and help control pain.

Now psychologists are confirming that music can also help relieve depression and improve concentration.

W: That's nice. Do they have any concrete examples?

M: For instance, in a recent study, 15 surgeons were given some highly stressed math problems to solve.

They were divided into three groups: one worked in silence; and in another, the surgeons listened to music of their choice on headphones; the third listened to classical music chosen by the researchers.

W: What were the results?

M: The results of the study may surprise you.

The doctors who got to choose their music experienced less stress and scored better than the others.

W: That is surprising. How to explain this?

M: One possible explanation is that listening to music you like stimulates the Alfa-wave in the brain, increases the heart rate and expands the breathing.

That helps to reduce stress and sharpen concentration.

W: Is there any other research?

M: Yes. Another research suggests a second relation between the music and the brain: By examining the students' blood after listening to a variety of classical music collections, the researchers found that some students showed a large increase in a chemical substance-a natural pain reliever-in their blood, which can help soothe the patient.

W: Well, thank you so much for being with us today and having us know about another function of music.

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

12. What is the talk mainly about?

. . . . . .

13. According to the speaker, how is the music therapy currently used in medicine?

. . . . . .

14. What did the study done with surgeons show?

. . . . . .

15. What effect did music have in the study of students exposed to classical music?

. . . . . .

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) . Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

Jane Brown's been married for 12 years.

She has three children and lives in the suburb outside Columbus, Ohio.

When her youngest child reached school age, Jane decided to go back to work.

She thought that she should contribute to the household finances.

Her salary could make the difference between the financial struggle and a secure financial situation for her family.

Jane also felt bored and frustrated in her role as a homemaker and wanted to be more involved in life outside her home.

Jane was worried about her children's adjustment to this new situation.

But she arranged for them to go stay with a woman nearby after school each afternoon.

They seemed to be happy with the arrangement.

The problem seemed to be between Jane and her husband, Bill.

When Jane was at home all day, she was able to clean the house, go grocery shopping, wash the clothes, take care of the children and cook two or three meals each day.

She was very busy, of course, but she succeeded in getting everything done.

Now these same things need to be done.

But Jane has only evenings and early mornings to do them.

Both Jane and Bill are tired when they arrive home at 6 p. m. Bill's accustomed to sitting down and reading the paper or watching TV until dinner is ready.

This is exactly what Jane feels like doing.

But someone has to fix dinner and Bill expects that to be Jane.

Jane's becoming very angry at Bill's attitude.

She feels that they should share the household jobs.

But Bill feels that everything should be the same as it was before Jane went back to work.

Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.

16. Why did Jane want to go back to work?

. . . . . .

17. How did Jane spend her days before she went back to work?

. . . . . .

18. What problem arose when Jane went back to work?

. . . . . .

19. What does the story try to tell us?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

The Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction is a program designed to reduce the impact of natural disasters throughout the world.

With support from the United Nations, countries will be encouraged to share information about disaster reduction, for instance, information about how to plan for and cope with hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.

One of the most important things the program plans to do is to remind us of what we can do to protect ourselves.

For example, we can pack a suitcase with flashlights, a radio, food, drinking water and some tools.

This safety kit may help us survive a disaster until help arrives.

Besides, the program will encourage governments to establish building standards, emergency response plans and training programs.

These measures can help to limit the destruction by natural disasters.

The comparatively mild effects of the northern California earthquake in 1989, are good evidence that we do have the technology to prevent vast destruction.

The recent disasters, on the other hand, prove that people will suffer if we don't use that technology.

When a highway collapsed in northern California, people were killed in their cars.

The highway was not built according to today's strict standards to resist earthquakes.

Individuals and governments have to be farsighted.

We should take extra time and spend extra money to build disaster safety into our lives.

Although such a program can't hold back the winds or stop earthquakes, it can save people's lives and homes.

Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.

20. What is the purpose of the program mentioned in this passage?

. . . . . .

21. What can we learn from the northern California earthquake in 1989?

. . . . . .

22. Why did the highway in northern California collapse?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

Living at the foot of one of the world's most active volcanoes might not appeal to you at all.

But believe it or not, the area surrounding Mount Etna in Italy is packed with people.

In fact, it is the most densely-populated region on the whole island of Sicily.

The reason is that rich volcanic soil makes the land fantastic for farming.

By growing and selling a variety of crops, local people earn a good living.

For them, the economic benefit they reap surpasses the risk of dying or losing property in one of the volcano's frequent eruptions.

People everywhere make decisions about risky situations this way, that is, by comparing the risks and the benefits.

According to the experts, the size of the risk depends on both its probability and seriousness.

Let's take Mount Etna for example.

It does erupt frequently. But those eruptions are usually minor.

So the overall risk for people living nearby is relatively small.

But suppose Mount Etna erupted every day or imagine that each eruption there killed thousands of people.

If that were the case, the risk would be much larger.

Indeed, the risk would be too large for many people to live with.

And they would have to move away.

Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

23. How do people make decisions about risky situations?

. . . . . .

24. What do we know about Mount Etna from the passage?

. . . . . .

25. What will people living near Mount Etna do in the face of its eruptions?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

Certain phrases one commonly hears among Americans capture their devotion to individualism: Do your own thing.

I did it my way.

You'll have to decide that for yourself.

You made your bed, now lie in it.

If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will.

Look out for number one.

Closely associated with the value they place on individualism is the importance Americans assign to privacy.

Americans assume that people need some time to themselves or some time alone to think about things or recover their spent psychological energy.

Americans have great difficulty understanding foreigners who always want to be with another person, who dislike being alone.

If the parents can afford it, each child will have his or her own bedroom

Having ones own bedroom even as an infant, fixes in a person the notion that she is entitled to a place of her own where she can be by herself, and keep her possessions.

She will have her clothes, her toys, her books, and so on.

These things will be hers and no one else's.

Americans assume that people will have their private thoughts that might never be shared with anyone.

Doctors, lawyers, psychiatrists, and others have rules governing confidentiality that are intended to prevent information about their clients' personal situations from becoming known to others.

Americans' attitudes about privacy can be hard for foreigners to understand.

Americans' houses, yards and even their offices can seem open and inviting.

Yet in the minds of Americans', there are boundaries that other people are simply not supposed to cross.

When those boundaries are crossed, an American's body will visibly stiffen and his manner will become cool and aloof.

Now the passage will be read again.
