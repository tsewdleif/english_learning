College English Test (Band 6)

Part II Listening Comprehension

Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) , and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the center.

Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.

1. M: Look at the low prices on these fashionable TV sets.

Something is fishy, don't you think so?

W: Well, there have been a lot of robberies recently.

Some of the stolen goods may have landed here.

Q: What does the woman imply about the low-priced television sets?

. . . . . .

2. M: I've been assigned to cover the governor speech today. What about you?

W: Nothing is grand as yours.

I have to do an interview for the evening news about a man with dozens of cats.

Q: What do we learn about the speakers?

. . . . . .

3. W: Didn't I see you going into the administration building this afternoon?

M: I needed to switch my computer class to the 9:50 section.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

4. W:4. W：

I guess you watched the quiz show on television last night.

What did you think about it?

M: Well, it's​ great. The first four contestants won only small prizes, but the fifth left with a new luxury car.

Q: What does the man say about the quiz show?

. . . . . .

5. W: I can't find the arrival time of the New York to Boston Express on this schedule.

M: Look for New York in the left-hand column and follow it across until you find the hour listed in the Boston column.

Q: What are the speakers most probably doing?

. . . . . .

6. W: You look different today, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is.

M: Oh, yesterday I finally got around to that new barbershop in the mall and enjoyed their services.

Q: What can be inferred about the man?

. . . . . .

7. W: What do you think of Picassos painting exhibited in the city museum?

M: Personally I can't quite see the meaning in his modern works.

Most of them remind me of the stuff my nephew brings home from the kindergarten.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

8. W: Rod said he wanted to get involved in student government this year.

M: But he hasn't gone to a single meeting, has he?

Q: What does the man imply about Rod?

. . . . . .

Now you'll hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

M: Good morning, madam! Can I help you?

W: Oh, I do hope so.

I have to get to Manchester today and my own car has broken down.

Do you by any chance have a car available?

M: For how many days, madam?

W: Three, just until the weekend.

M: And what sort of car did you have in mind?

W: Well. That depends a bit on the price.

But I normally drive a Chevrolet.

Do you have anything like that?

M: Yes, certainly. That's group C which includes Chevrolet and Sea-arrows.

W: How much are they?

M: Well, for three days, you would have to have it under the unlimited mileage conditions, which will work out cheaper for Manchester anyway.

Let's see, Group C, three to five days hire with unlimited mileage is 53 pounds per day.

W: I see. Does that include everything?

M: It includes third-party insurance, but does not include value-added tax, petrol or CDW. - W: What's that?

M: CDW? Oh, that's to cover you in case you damage the hired car.

Third party insurance only covers you for damage to another vehicle.

For Group C car is 6 pounds per day.

W: OK. I think I'll have the Chevrolet.

M: Right. Could I have your driving license, please?

W: Certainly. Here we are.

M: So, it's Ms. J. B. Couty. - W: Yes. That's right.

M: And the number is 509024bc9cs, expiring the 1st of July, 2015.

And do you want to take it immediately?

W: Yes, I do, please.

M: Lovely. Well, if you could just initial that box there for the CDW, and that box there to confirm you have no driving convictions, thank you. And then sign there. Great! That's it!

. . . . . .

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

. . . . . .

10. What is the woman's main consideration in hiring a car?

. . . . . .

11. What does the daily charge include?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

W: So, possible locations for the plant.

First, the basic facilities for the region are generally very good.

At least between the three main cities, Bilbao, Victoria in the south and Suns Bastion.

There is now a fast train link to the south of France and to the west of Spain.

Are there improvements affect Bilbao principally?

But, the whole region benefits.

First, the port area has been completely modernized and relocated.

And the airport has also been extended.

So the basic facilities are good.

M: Right. So, are we in a position to choose one of these cities?

W: Well, let's not rush into anything.

I think it'll be a bad idea to assume we're going to choose a city.

It might be better to think about one of the smaller towns.

M: Smaller places. Yes. So, should we get details on the possible places?

W: Yes. We could do that.

But, we need, I think, first, to check a few things.

For example, tax benefits, grants, and anything like that for locating to a smaller place, not one of the main cities, then we can make a better decision.

M: Yes, I agree. You've talked about the improved transport links in Bilbao.

What about the links to the smaller towns

If it's a mountainous or hilly reigon, it could take an hour or more for a truck to reach a main road.

So I think we need to look specifically at the train and road links for smaller towns.

W: Yes. You're right. Road and rail and financial position.

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) . Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

In a study of older people with sisters and brothers, psychologist Debra Gold of the Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development found that about 20% said they were either hostile or indifferent toward their sisters and brothers.

Reasons for this ranged from inheritance disputes to hostility between spouses.

But, many of those who had poor relationships felt guilty.

Although most people admitted to some lingering rivalry, it was rarely strong enough to end the relationship.

Only four out of the 54 people interviewed had completely broken with their sisters and brothers and only one of the four felt comfortable with the break.

As sisters and brothers advanced into old age, closeness increases and rivalry diminishes, explains Victor Cicirelli, a psychologist at Purdue University.

Most of the elderly people he interviewed said they had supportive and friendly dealings and got along well or very well with their sisters and brothers.

Only 4% got along poorly.

Gold found that as people age, they often become more involved with and interested in their sisters and brothers.

53% of those she interviewed said that contact with their sisters and brothers increase in late adulthood.

With family and career obligations reduced, many said that they had more time for each other.

Others said that they felt it was time to heal wounds.

A man who had recently reconciled with his brother, told Gold there's something that lets older people put aside the bad deeds of the past and focus a little on what we need now, especially when it's sisters and brothers.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.

16. What does the study by Debra Gold find about older people?

. . . . . .

17. What has probably caused closeness to increase among sisters and brothers according to Victor Cicirelli?

. . . . . .

18. What did the man who had recently reconciled with his brother tell Debra Gold about older people?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

Monarch butterflies, the large orange and black insects, are a common summer sight in the northern United States and Canada.

They brighten parks and gardens as they fly among the flowers.

What makes monarch butterflies particularly interesting is they migrate, all the way to California or Mexico in back.

They are thought to be the only insect that does this.

Every year in the late summer, monarchs begin their migration to the south, those heading for Mexico go first for the Louisiana Mississippi region.

Then they fly across the Gulf of Mexico into Texas. Once in Mexico, they establish themselves in one of about 15 sites in the mountain forest.

Each site provides the winter home for millions of monarchs.

The butterflies are so numerous that they often cover entire trees.

When spring comes, they began their long journey north.

The question is often asked whether every butterfly makes the round trip journey every year. And the answer is no.

The average monarch lives about nine months.

So when flying north, they might lay eggs in Louisiana and die.

The eggs of that generation may be found in Kentucky; the eggs of the next generation may end up in Wisconsin or Michigan.

The last generation of the season about the fourth will make the journey back to Mexico and restart the cycle.

Scientists learn about monarch butterflies migration by capturing and placing identifying tags on the insects.

By recapturing the tagged monarch and noting where they came from, the next scientist can figure out things like the butterfly's age and its routine.

Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.

19. What is unique about the monarch butterflies according to the speaker?

. . . . . .

20. Where do monarch butterflies settle at the end of the migration?

. . . . . .

21. What does the speaker say about monarch butterflies reproduction?

. . . . . .

22. What is the talk mainly about?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

People nowadays seem to have the sense that their time has become more limited.

That compared to earlier generations we spend more and more time working and have less and less free time to engage in leisure pursuits.

But this premise turns out to be an illusion.

The most comprehensive data from Major Time Use Service suggests that if anything, Americans today have more free time than earlier​ generations.

The number of hours we work has not changed much, but we spend less time now on home tasks.

So we have a great amount of time for leisure than in decades past.

So, why do we feel like time is so scarce? One problem is that our time has become more valuable and as time becomes worth more money, we feel like we have less of it.

Workers who bill or get paid by the hour, think employers and fast-food workers, report focusing more on pursuing more money than those who get paid by salary and the effect happens fast.

In one experiment, people were told to play the role of consultants and bill their time at either nine dollars an hour or ninety dollars an hour.

When people billed their time for ninety dollars an hour they reported feeling far more pressed for time.

Thinking about our time as money, changes our behavior as well.

In one study, people who were instructed to think about money before entering a cafe spent less time chatting with the other patrons and more time working.

Those who are thinking about their time did the reverse, spending time socializing instead of working.

Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

23. What does the speaker say people now feel about time?

. . . . . .

24. What do the data from Major Time Use Service show?

. . . . . .

25. What happens when we think about our time as money?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

The first copyright law in the United States was passed by congress in 1790.

In 1976, congress enacted the latest copyright law, taking into consideration the technological developments that had occurred since the passage of the copyright act of 1909.

For example, in 1909 anyone who wanted to make a single copy of a literary work for personal use had to do so by hand.

The very process imposed a limitation on the quantity of materials copied.

Today, a photocopier can do the work in seconds. The limitation has disappeared.

The 1909 Law did not provide full protection for films and sound recordings, nor did it anticipate the needs to protect radio and television.

As a result, violations of the law and abuses of the intent of the law have lessened the financial rewards of authors, artists and producers.

The 1976 copyright act has not prevented these abuses fully, but it has clarified the legal rights of the injured parties and given them an avenue for remedy.

Since 1976 the act has been amended to include computer software and guidelines have been adopted for fair use of television broadcasts.

These changes have cleared up much of the confusion and conflict that followed in the wake of 1976 legislation.

The fine points of the law are decided by the courts and by acceptable common practice overtime.

As these decisions and agreements are made, we modify our behavior accordingly.

For now, we need to interpret the law and its guidelines as accurately as we can and to act in a fair manner.

Now, the passage will be read again.
