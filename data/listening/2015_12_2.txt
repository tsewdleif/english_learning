College English Test (Band 6)

Part II Listening Comprehension

Section A

Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.

After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) , and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Now let's begin with the eight short conversations.

Question 1. W: I'm so frustrated with this new computer program.

I just can't figure it out.

M: I know what you mean.

It can be overwhelming, especially since the technology is always changing.

By the time you learn one program, it's outdated.

Q: What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?

. . . . . .

Question 2. W: Don't you wish you were going away for the holiday?

M: No, I'm happy to stay at home.

It's pretty irritating having to fight all that holiday traffic just to get out of town for a couple of days.

Q: What does the man mean?

. . . . . .

Question 3. W: We're new in East Asia, so we have to be careful in choosing the location for our regional office.

M: Well, Tokyo and Singapore are both attractive, but the living expenses there are incredibly high.

Q: What are the speakers discussing?

. . . . . .

Question 4. W: Excuse me, did anybody see my cell phone after the last show?

It may have slipped out of my pocket during the performance.

M: In fact, we found several.

Please go check at the ticket counter.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

. . . . . .

Question 5. W: Will you be able to complete the project on time?

M: Well, I'm having my carpenters work full time, but some of the important building materials are being delayed at the customs.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

. . . . . .

Question 6. W: I wish I hadn't hurt Jane's feelings like that.

You know I never meant to.

M: One thing I like about Jane is she doesn't harbor resentment.

I guess she'll have forgotten all about it by tomorrow.

Q: What does the man say about Jane?

. . . . . .

Question 7. M: The next place I will show you is going for a great price.

The owners are moving to a foreign country, so they have to sell it immediately.

W: It's beautiful.

I like the small apartment attached to the back.

We could rent it out to help with our mortgage payments.

Q: What do we learn about the speakers from the conversation?

. . . . . .

Question 8. W: Did you read the Morning News?

They did a story on our election campaign.

M: Sure. I guess it will spark some interest among the women in town.

Without their votes, we won't be able to win the election.

Q: What do we learn about the speakers from the conversation?

. . . . . .

Now you will hear the two long conversations.

Conversation One

W: Charles, as a singer, do you ever make yourself cry when you sing?

M: No, not at this age.

I'm an old man.

But the songs can still get through to me.

W: What song writers are currently exciting you?

M: I don't know much about song writers.

Once in a while, I'll listen to the radio to see what they are putting out, but it's not too often I hear something I like.

Somebody like Art Tatum can make me sit up and take notice, but some music, like rap, isn't very musical and I can't learn anything from it.

You got to do something more than talk to me.

W: What's the most difficult kind of music to sing?

M: It depends.

If I like something, I can sing it.

I did the opera Porgiam best and that's said to be a complicated piece of music.

And I can do country music, blues and love songs.

On the other hand, I can't sing something I don't like and that's one of my defects.

W: Can you perform music that's out of tune with the mood you might be in on a given night?

M: Yes, because when you sing, you are like an actor performing a part.

Once you get out there, you become that part- only you're using music instead of dialogue.

I am the kind of a person that if my personal life is hurting, I can go to work and the music will take over.

It's like a guy who goes to a bar and drinks.

For those few hours, I can wrap myself up in my music.

Questions 9 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Question 9. What does Charles say songs can do when he sings them?

. . . . . .

Question10. What does Charles say about himself as a singer?

Question11. What would Charles do when his personal life is hurting?

. . . . . .

Conversation Two

W: I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about your job as a radio announcer.

What do you actually do and how do you prepare for your job?

M: Well, in the news room I am sitting with reporters and news-subs, as though I am sitting in a newspaper news room.

W: Sorry, what do you mean by news-subs?

M: They are sub-editors.

They are the people who write the news stories as they come in.

The stories are then passed to the senior duty editor and the assistant editor.

As stories go through the chain of people, they are refined, corrected and sorted out until they come finally to me and I have a chance to read through most stories before I go on the air.

Of course, sometimes things happen at the last moment and I don't have a chance.

So I've just got to do my best, and take a couple of seconds to look through the first few lines before I launch into something.

Because it's such a pity if you start off on a bright tone on a story and suddenly realize you are talking about some people having been killed in a road crash.

It is very important to just have a quick flip through.

W: There is nothing to mark what is out of entity on your piece of paper?

M: No, I have my own little mark.

If it's something sad, I'll put a small cross at the top.

That's my little clue.

So while I am working on the news, I'm just absorbing the news and checking pronunciations.

Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

Question 12. What does the woman want to know about the man?

. . . . . .

Question 13. What does the man say news-subs do?

. . . . . .

Question 14. What does the man say is a big challenge for him?

. . . . . .

Question 15. What role does the man say his small cross plays?

. . . . . .

Section B

Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.

After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D) . Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

You probably know what a mobile is, but the mobile I'm talking about is a delicate object of decoration hanging from the ceiling and moving gently with every breath.

It delights both children and adults.

Now, do you know who invented the mobile?

This lovely creation was the work of an American artist named Alexander Calder.

Calder became interested in making things when he was a child.

And even then he often used wire in his constructions.

When he went to college, he studied engineering rather than art.

But he quickly realized that art was his real passion.

He also loved the circus, and many of his early artworks were small circus figures made with wire.

In about 1930, Calder turned from realistic wire figures to abstract ones.

He began constructing objects that have circles, squares and other geometric shapes.

To get the shapes to move, he used small motors.

Then he went one step beyond these early mobiles.

He got the shapes in his constructions to move by themselves.

A mobile may look simple as it shifts in the wind, but it requires careful construction to work properly.

Calder used his engineering knowledge to create his first mobiles.

Often these consisted of small pieces of brightly printed metal strung by wire to a thicker base wire.

Calder learnt how to find the precise point to connect each wire so that all the pieces will sway in harmony.

In doing so, he created an art form for people all over the world to copy and enjoy.

Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 16. What does the speaker say about a mobile?

. . . . . .

Question 17. What do we learn about many of Alexander Calder's early artworks?

. . . . . .

Question 18. Where does Alexander Calder's real passion lie?

. . . . . .

Passage Two

If sheer numbers provide any proof, America's universities are the envy of the world.

For all their troubles, the United States' 3 500 institutions were flooded with more than half a million students from 193 countries last year.

Asia led the way, with the biggest number from China, followed by Japan and India.

Most European and Asian universities provide an elite service to a small number of people.

While fully 60% of all US high school graduates attend college of some point in their life, just 30% of the comparable German population, 28% of the French, 20% of the British, and 37% of the Japanese proceed beyond high school.

Britains who pass their A levels may still not qualify for a top university at home, but find American universities far more welcoming.

Some US schools acknowledge the rigor of European secondary training, and will give up to a year's credit to foreigners who have passed their high school exams.

"The conception that everyone has a right to an education appropriate to his potential is a highly democratic and compassionate standard," says Marven Breselor, a professor at Princeton University.

True, not all US students can match the performance of their foreign counterparts, but the American institutions do offer students from rich and poor families alike the chance to realize their full potential.

"America educates so many more people at university that one can't expect all those who go to be as intelligent as the much narrower band in British universities," says professor Christopher Rakes at Boston university, "I'm not against elitism, but I happen to like having people who are more eager to learn."

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 19. What does the speaker say about America's universities?

. . . . . .

Question 20. What is American's view on education according to Professor Marven Breselor?

. . . . . .

Question 21. What do we learn from Professor Christopher Rakes' remark?

. . . . . .

Passage Three

Every year, people in America use energy equal to over 30 million barrels of oil each day.

That's energy in all forms— oil, gas, coal, nuclear, solar and even wind power.

Viewed from scientists' standpoint, all the energy contained in fuel either now or in the future becomes heat.

Some of the heat is used directly or produces useful work; the rest is lost or rejected, radiated into the atmosphere from the engines, motors, boilers and all the other energy-consuming machinery that makes Americans' wheels go around.

If we could figure out how to improve the efficiency with which we use energy, we can do a lot more work with the energy that is available.

With money and careful planning, we can boost efficiency up to a point.

Yet improvement won't come easily, it won't come overnight and there are limits beyond which not even science can take us.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, about three quarters of the energy we use to move things, including ourselves, accomplishes no useful work.

In terms of efficiency and cleanness, buses, trains and other forms of public or mass transportation are superior to the private automobile.

But only if they operate at near capacity, otherwise, their overall efficiency is poor.

For some people, mass transit may answer all transportation needs.

For others, a combination of mass transit and private transportation may be desirable.

Better design and wiser use of both mass transit systems and private vehicles will play an important part in helping America get more out of energy used for transportation.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Question 22. What does the speaker say about energy used in the United States?

. . . . . .

Question 23. What do scientists say about energy contained in fuel?

. . . . . .

Question 24. When does mass transit prove superior to private vehicles?

. . . . . .

Question 25. What seems to be the speaker's biggest concern?

. . . . . .

Section C

Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard.

Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage.

Graphics are used in textbooks as part of the language of the discipline, as in math or economics, or as study aids.

Authors use graphic aids to illustrate and expand on concepts taken up in the text because graphics are yet another way of portraying relationships and clarifying connections.

Graphics are used extensively in natural sciences and social sciences.

Social scientists work with statistics derived from data, and the best way to present these statistics is often in graphic form.

Graphics are included not merely as a means of making the information easier for the student to grasp, but as an integral part of the way social scientists think.

Many textbooks, particularly those in economics, contain appendixes that provide specific information on reading and working with graphic material.

Make it a practice to preview attentively the titles, captions, headings, and other material connected with graphics.

These elements set the stage and usually explain what you are looking at.

When you are examining graphics, the principal questions to ask are (a) What is this item about?

And (b) What key idea is the author communicating.

One warning: Unless you integrate your reading of graphics with the text, you may make a wrong assumption.

For instance, from a chart indicating that 33 percent of firstborn children in a research sample did not feel close to their fathers, you might assume that some dreadful influence was at work on the firstborn children.

However, a careful reading of the text reveals that most of the firstborn children in the sample were from single-parent homes in which the father was absent.

Now the passage will be read again.
